# The Socrates & Donuts Manifesto

## Five Principles

1. We don't fix — We help you see
2. We don't advise — Only questions, never answers
3. We don't replace people — Tool for clarity, then go to humans
4. We slow things down — Protect the pause
5. Seeing is enough — No gamification, no progress tracking

If a feature conflicts with these principles, the feature loses. Always.
