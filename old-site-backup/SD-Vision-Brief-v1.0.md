## Why We Are Writing This

What we have right now is too light.

Socrates & Donuts launched as a crisis tool — a place to go when you are angry, hurt, anxious, or about to do something you might regret. That function is real and it works. But it serves you only in the worst moments, which means most of the time it sits unused. A tool you only reach for in crisis is not a companion. It is a fire extinguisher.

That is not what this was meant to be.

The name says it. Socrates didn't sit with people in crisis. He sat with people over a meal, in the marketplace, in the middle of ordinary life — and asked them questions that changed how they saw everything. The conversation was the point. Not the emergency. The examined life, lived daily, not just when something breaks.

The donut is warmth. Approachability. The pleasure of sitting down with someone you trust and talking about what actually matters. No agenda. No performance. No record being kept to be used against you.

That combination — rigorous inquiry delivered with warmth and without judgment — is what S&D should be. And right now, it isn't that yet. It's a first draft of a much more important idea.

This document describes what S&D should become, why, and how we will build it without asking users for anything they shouldn't have to give.

## The Problem with What Exists

**The Mirror** covers six emotional states: decision, anger, hurt, sadness, anxiety, and "something else bothering me." This is useful when you are in distress. But it assumes you are always arriving in distress. Most people aren't. Most people arrive curious, or restless, or looking for something they can't quite name.

**The Vipassana section** navigates back to the previous page. It does not exist in any meaningful sense. This is a significant gap — the founder of this tool is a Vipassana practitioner, and the most sophisticated contemplative intelligence available is entirely absent.

**The Vault** holds unsent letters. Good feature. Sits there without context or purpose beyond storage.

**There is no outbound intelligence.** S&D waits for you to arrive. It never reaches out. It doesn't know what day it is in your practice, what question you're sitting with, or what you haven't resolved from three weeks ago. It is passive when it should be present.

**There is no longitudinal memory.** Every session is the first session. The tool has no idea you've asked the same question four times without resolving it. It can't tell you it's noticed something. It can't surface the aphorism you saved in October at exactly the moment it becomes relevant. Each visit starts from zero.

**There is no Socratic depth.** The Mirror asks which state you're in and then responds. But Socrates didn't respond — he asked. He asked until you found the thing you were actually looking for, which was rarely the thing you said you were looking for. That method — patient, rigorous, non-judgmental questioning that surfaces what you're not seeing — is almost entirely absent from the current build.

---

## The Vision

Socrates & Donuts is a daily companion for the examined life.

Not a crisis tool. Not a meditation app. Not a journaling app. Not therapy. Something that doesn't quite exist yet — a place where Socratic method meets contemplative practice and meets the ordinary texture of your days, and where genuine intelligence accumulates over time to ask you what you're not asking yourself.

**Three principles govern everything:**

**1. Privacy without compromise**
No registration. No email. No account. Your reflection space lives in your browser, not our servers. We cannot read it. We cannot sell it. It belongs to you. This is not a limitation — it is a design choice that makes honesty possible. You cannot be fully honest in a space you don't fully own.

**2. The question travels to you**
You should not have to remember to reflect. A daily question arrives on your phone or in your morning briefing. No app to open, no habit to build. The question finds you where you are. If it catches you, you follow it deeper. If not, it passes. Either way, you were asked.

**3. Each visit should be irreplaceable**
You should leave having had an insight you didn't have when you arrived. Not information — insight. The tool should be doing something you couldn't do alone: surfacing contradiction, holding the question longer than is comfortable, noticing what you keep returning to without resolving.

---

## What S&D Should Contain

### The Mirror — Deepened

Keep the current emotional entry points. They work. But what happens after you choose one needs to become genuinely Socratic.

**The Contradiction Finder** — within a single session, S&D tracks what you say and surfaces contradictions. "Earlier you said you value silence. You've described ten things you want to accomplish. Can both be true?" No memory needed — just attention within the session.

**The Forced Silence** — when you choose a question to explore, the input field locks for five minutes. A timer counts down. Nothing to do but sit with the question before answering. This is a direct application of Vipassana's central insight: the answer that comes after sitting is different from the first answer. S&D should demonstrate this rather than just describing it.

**The Devil's Advocate Protocol** — whatever position you articulate, S&D argues the other side. Not combatively — Socratically. You say "I want to simplify my life." S&D responds: "Here is the strongest case for complexity. Now tell me what you still believe." Forces you to deepen your conviction or discover you didn't actually hold it.

**The Hidden Third Option** — most presented decisions are false binaries. The Socratic companion challenges: is there an option you haven't considered? What would a genuinely creative person do here?

---

### The Vipassana Section — Built Properly

This is not a meditation tracker. Tracking sits is not the point.

**Pre-sit orientation** — 90 seconds before you sit. Three questions: What state am I arriving in? What am I carrying? What am I willing to look at? Not recorded for analysis — the act of answering is itself the practice. You arrive more consciously.

**Post-sit integration** — 3 minutes after sitting. What arose? Not what you thought about — what you *observed*. This vocabulary distinction matters deeply to practitioners. S&D reflects back using the language of observation rather than thought. Over time (in localStorage): "You've noted aversion in your last three sits. It tends to arise when you're carrying something unresolved. Is there something unresolved?"

**The Five Hindrances tracker** — sensual desire, aversion, sloth-torpor, restlessness-worry, doubt. These are the specific mental states Vipassana practitioners recognise and work with. A simple log where you mark which were present. After sufficient entries, patterns surface: "Restlessness tends to appear on days when you worked more than ten hours."

**The integration gap question** — this is the hardest and most valuable. "You noticed X in your sit. Where in your daily life does X appear right now?" The gap between the cushion and the kitchen is where Vipassana either becomes a way of life or remains a retreat. This question is what makes it life.

**Retreat preparation and return** — a 10-entry container for before or after a retreat. Each day one entry. S&D holds the arc across the ten days and synthesises at the end.

---

### The Examined Life — Daily Practice

**Morning orientation** — Before the day begins. Three Socratic questions. Takes three minutes. What am I moving toward today? What am I avoiding? What would make this a good day — not productive, *good*? The act of answering orients the day differently than a to-do list does.

**Evening reflection** — The Examen, secular and Socratic. What happened today that surprised me? Where did I act from fear versus from choice? What would I do differently? Not journaling — a guided five-minute dialogue.

**The One Year Letter** — Write a letter to yourself to be opened in 365 days. Stored in the vault. S&D surfaces it exactly one year later: "You wrote this in February 2026. Read it now."

**The 6-word truth** — a Hemingway constraint. Describe your current situation in exactly six words. Then what you want in six words. Then what is in the way in six words. Compression forces clarity that paragraphs cannot. Simple, fast, surprisingly revealing.

---

### The Philosophical Dialogues

Actual Socratic dialogues on questions that matter:

- What is a good life? (Not a successful one)
- What do I owe other people?
- How should I relate to suffering?
- What would I do if I had six months left?
- What am I avoiding becoming?
- What is the story I tell about myself, and is it true?
- What does it mean to be free?

These are not self-help questions. They carry 2,500 years of thought. S&D conducts genuine dialogue — not giving answers, but following Socratic method: ask, challenge the assumption, ask again, find the contradiction, look at it. Each dialogue takes 10-20 minutes. You leave differently than you arrived.

---

### The Relationships Domain

**The Relationship Mirror** — not when you're angry, but as a regular practice. How am I showing up in this relationship? What am I bringing? What am I not saying? Who am I being to this person?

**The Difficult Conversation Preparation** — not professional communication (that's ELAINE's job). This is personal. You need to tell someone something true and hard. S&D walks you through Socratic preparation: what do you actually want to say, what do you fear will happen, what is your real intention, what does the other person most need to hear.

**Forgiveness work** — not religious, not therapeutic. Socratic. What would it cost you to forgive? What do you gain from not forgiving? Who are you in the version of this story where you forgive?

**Unsent letters** — write to someone you cannot or will not write to. Your younger self. Someone who hurt you. Someone you hurt. Someone who died. The letter is never sent — it exists for you. Stored in the vault. Six months later, S&D surfaces it: "You wrote this in February. Do you still feel this way?"

---

### The Belief Audit

Pure Socrates. He spent his life asking people why they believed what they believed.

**What do you believe about money?** — Not what you say you believe. What your behaviour reveals. S&D conducts a dialogue that surfaces the operative belief rather than the stated one.

**Inherited beliefs versus chosen beliefs** — which of your beliefs did you choose, and which did you inherit? The Socratic companion asks you to examine the difference and choose consciously.

**The Temporal Audit** — using localStorage: "You explored this question in March. Your answer was X. You appear to hold Y now. When did that shift? Was it conscious?"

---

### The Body Wisdom

**The somatic check-in** — where in your body are you holding tension right now? Point to it. What emotion lives there? If it could speak, what would it say? This is body-as-oracle, not body-as-machine. Fits directly with Vipassana's emphasis on bodily sensation as the primary site of practice.

**The symptom inquiry** — not medical advice. Socratic. "You've been tired for three weeks. You mentioned a significant decision three weeks ago. Are these connected? Let's look."

---

### The Wisdom Library — The Vault Expanded

**Aphorisms you've collected** — the lines that hit you. S&D surfaces them when contextually relevant within a session. "You saved this three months ago: 'The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek.' You're describing a cave right now."

**Your own insights** — after a dialogue, if you reached a genuine insight, you save it. It becomes part of your personal wisdom library. A year later S&D asks: "Do you still believe this?"

**The Question you keep returning to** — localStorage tracks which questions you approach repeatedly without resolving. After the third time: "You've asked this before. You didn't resolve it last time either. What makes it difficult to answer?"

---

## The Push System — How S&D Reaches You

The most important shift. S&D stops waiting and starts arriving.

### For Everyone — Browser Notifications (Zero Cost, Zero Registration)

On first visit, after 30 seconds (not immediately — let them experience the app first), a gentle banner appears:

> "Get one question each morning? No account needed. Lives in your browser, not our servers."

If they say yes, the browser asks permission. That's it. Every morning at their configured time (default 7am), a notification appears on their screen with the day's question. Clicking it opens S&D with the question pre-loaded and waiting.

The question bank is 365 questions, built into the app. No server. No API. No cost. Today's question is selected by day of year — everyone on the same question the same day, which creates a subtle sense of shared practice even among strangers who don't know each other.

### For Mani — SMS via TextBee + n8n

TextBee uses your existing Android phone's SMS — no per-message cost beyond your phone plan. n8n is already running.

Every morning at 7am Sydney time, n8n sends one question to your phone via TextBee. You don't need to open any app. The question is already with you.

You reply to the SMS. TextBee webhooks the reply back to ELAINE. ELAINE saves it to your personal vault. The entry is timestamped, tagged by category, and accessible in the vault viewer.

If the question catches you and you want to go deeper, you open S&D on the browser and the conversation continues from where the SMS left off.

### For Mani — ELAINE Morning Briefing Integration

ELAINE's morning briefing already reaches you daily. S&D contributes one question to that briefing — not as a separate section but woven in:

> "S&D question for today: You've mentioned the difficult conversation three times this week. What are you waiting for?"

This is the longitudinal intelligence — the question generated not from a rotation but from what ELAINE knows you've been sitting with. It doesn't require you to open S&D. It arrives in the briefing you already read.

---

## What We Are Not Building

**We are not building a wellness app.** Wellness apps make you feel better. S&D makes you see more clearly. These are not the same thing and sometimes they are opposites.

**We are not building a meditation timer.** There are hundreds. The sitting is not our business. What you do with what you noticed in the sitting — that is our business.

**We are not building therapy.** S&D does not diagnose, does not treat, does not refer (though it can gently suggest when something seems beyond its scope). It is a philosophical companion, not a clinical tool.

**We are not building a social product.** No sharing, no likes, no community features. Reflection requires privacy. Privacy requires no audience.

---

## The Technical Architecture

**Public S&D** — fully static. GitHub Pages. No server. No backend. No cost to run. Everything in localStorage. Web Push API for notifications. Service worker for offline use. The entire app works without an internet connection after first load.

**Mani's personal layer** — TextBee + n8n + ELAINE. Three integrations, all already in the ecosystem. No new infrastructure. No new cost.

**AI** — Ollama locally for session dialogue. The question generation, contradiction finding, Socratic responses — all local. No cloud AI costs for the public app (questions are pre-written). Cloud AI only if the user has their own keys and opts in.

---

## The Patentable Ideas

Eight new intellectual property candidates emerging from this vision:

| ID | Name | Description |
|---|---|---|
| SD-01 | Somatic-Socratic Dialogue Engine™ | Combines body location check-in (where in your body is this?) with Socratic questioning to surface insights inaccessible through purely cognitive approaches |
| SD-02 | Temporal Belief Auditor™ | Tracks stated beliefs across localStorage sessions and surfaces contradictions and evolution over time |
| SD-03 | Integration Gap Tracker™ | For contemplative practitioners: maps the distance between meditative insight and behavioural change, identifies where insight isn't translating into life |
| SD-04 | Wisdom Resonance Engine™ | Surfaces saved aphorisms and personal insights at contextually relevant moments based on current session content |
| SD-05 | Forced Silence Input Protocol™ | Input field locked for configurable duration after question presentation — enforces sitting with a question before answering, implementing contemplative pedagogy in a digital interface |
| SD-06 | Contradiction Surfacing Engine™ | Tracks stated positions within a single session and surfaces logical contradictions Socratically — no persistence required |
| SD-07 | Question Recurrence Detector™ | Identifies questions a user approaches repeatedly without resolving across sessions and surfaces the pattern as a Socratic observation |
| SD-08 | Contemplative Push Architecture™ | SMS-to-vault pipeline combining existing phone infrastructure (TextBee) with local AI and daily briefing system for zero-cost daily contemplative practice delivery |

## Open Questions for Feedback

1. **The no-registration constraint** — do you agree this is a feature, not a limitation? Or should we offer an optional account for users who want cross-device sync?

2. **The Forced Silence** — five minutes before you can type. Is this too long? Too confrontational? Or exactly right?

3. **The Devil's Advocate Protocol** — S&D argues against your stated position. Some people will find this energising. Others will find it alienating. How do we frame this so people understand it's an act of care, not attack?

4. **The Vipassana section** — should this be explicitly named and positioned, or should the Vipassana sensibility be a lens across the whole app rather than a separate section?

5. **The question bank** — 365 questions, one per day, same question for everyone on the same day. Does the shared-practice aspect feel meaningful? Or arbitrary?

6. **ELAINE integration** — the personalised question in the morning briefing (generated from what ELAINE knows you've been sitting with) — how much context should ELAINE pull from S&D sessions to generate this? All of it? Only themes, not specifics?

7. **The scope** — this document describes a significantly larger app than what exists. Should we build the full vision, or identify the five most important additions and build those first?

8. **Open source positioning** — who is this for beyond Mani? Vipassana practitioners? Knowledge workers who reflect? Philosophers? Everyone? The answer shapes the question bank, the language, and the onboarding.

---

## What We Build First

If forced to choose five things from this vision to build immediately:

1. **Fix the Vipassana section** — it currently navigates backwards. This is the most embarrassing gap and the most important feature for the founder's own practice.

2. **The Forced Silence** — five minutes before you can type. No AI needed. Pure design. Immediately differentiates S&D from every other reflection tool.

3. **The Contradiction Finder** — within-session only, no persistence needed. Makes every Mirror session genuinely Socratic rather than just responsive.

4. **Browser notifications** — zero cost, zero registration, daily presence. Solves the return problem without requiring any infrastructure.

5. **The SMS pipeline** — for Mani only. TextBee + n8n + vault. Personal layer on top of public foundation. Demonstrates the vision of a tool that comes to you.

Everything else in this document is real and worth building. But these five make S&D unrecognisable from what it is today — in the best possible way.

## Addendum — Data Portability

*Added 18 February 2026*

### The Problem with Browser-Only Storage

LocalStorage is a starting point, not a destination. It breaks in four common ways: the user clears their browser history and loses everything, they switch browsers, they use multiple devices, or the browser updates and wipes storage. For a tool whose entire value proposition is longitudinal — what you were sitting with six months ago, the letter you wrote last February, the question you keep returning to — losing that data is catastrophic.

The answer is not accounts or servers. The answer is **the user owns their file.**

### Export / Import System

**Export** — at any time, from Settings, the user can export their entire vault as a single JSON file. Human-readable. Named with the date: `sd-vault-2026-02-18.json`. They save it wherever they want — Dropbox, a hard drive, a USB. We never see it.

The export contains everything:
- All Mirror session summaries (not full transcripts — key insights and timestamps)
- All Vault entries (unsent letters, saved insights, aphorisms)
- Vipassana sit log (dates, states noted, hindrances)
- Morning orientation and evening reflection entries
- Question history (which questions appeared, whether they were answered)
- Belief audit snapshots
- The One Year Letters with their open dates
- Settings and preferences

**Import** — on any device, in any browser, the user can import their vault file. S&D reads it, merges it with any existing localStorage (deduplicating by timestamp), and they're home. Nothing was lost. The tool works exactly as before.

**Auto-export reminder** — every 30 days, S&D gently nudges: "Your vault hasn't been backed up in 30 days. Export it now?" One click. Zero friction.

**The framing** — "Your vault is yours. We can't read it, we can't lose it, we can't sell it. Export it anytime. Keep it wherever you keep the things that matter."

This is a genuine differentiator against every app that holds your data hostage in an account. S&D gives the data back — always, immediately, in a format you can open in any text editor.

### Format

The JSON export is structured but human-readable. A person who opens it in Notepad should be able to read their own entries. No proprietary encoding. No encryption (it's their file — if they want to encrypt it, they can). A future version could offer optional encryption with a passphrase they set, but not required.

```json
{
  "sd_vault": "1.0",
  "exported_at": "2026-02-18T14:00:00",
  "entries": [
    {
      "type": "mirror_session",

## Addendum — Wisdom Frameworks Woven Into S&D

*Added 18 February 2026*

### The Principle

No framework is named. No approach is labelled. The user never knows they're doing shadow work, Stoic negative visualisation, or motivational interviewing. They just notice that the questions are unusual, that something keeps getting surfaced, that they leave with something they didn't have when they arrived.

Named frameworks create resistance, create expectations, and date the tool. Unnamed, they live as the tool's intelligence — invisible, present, working.

What follows is the intellectual architecture behind S&D's questions and approaches. This is the map the tool uses. The user never sees the map — only the territory it reveals.

---

### 1. The Dark Mirror — Unnamed Shadow Work

Carl Jung's insight: the parts of yourself you most disown are the parts most energetically running your behaviour. What you condemn in others, you carry in yourself. What you refuse to see, you enact.

S&D surfaces this without naming it through three question types:

**The Projection Question** — "The quality that most irritates you in [person you described] — where in your own life does that quality appear, even slightly?" This is the shadow question. It will be uncomfortable. That's correct.

**The Refused Self** — "You described yourself as [quality they stated]. What's the opposite of that quality? How does the opposite show up in your life, even when you don't want it to?" The person who calls themselves organised carries chaos. The person who calls themselves generous carries selfishness. Finding it doesn't make it dominant — it makes it conscious.

**The Disowned Strength** — shadow isn't only dark material. Sometimes the part most disowned is a capability or quality deemed too much, too arrogant, too dangerous to claim. "You dismissed your skill in X quite quickly. What would it look like if you fully owned that?" Reclaiming positive shadow.

**The Recurring Figure** — "You've described this person three times in different sessions. What do they represent to you beyond the literal relationship?" Dream-logic applied to waking life.

S&D doesn't call this shadow work. It calls it "looking more carefully."

---

### 2. The Stoic Layer — Unnamed Stoicism

Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, and Seneca developed a technology for living under conditions you cannot control. Most of what makes people miserable is confusion between what is and isn't within their power.

S&D applies three Stoic tools without naming them:

**The Dichotomy of Control** — "Of everything you've described, what is actually within your control right now? What isn't? Let's stay only with what is." Deceptively simple. Profoundly clarifying. Most distress evaporates when the person stops trying to think their way to changing things outside their power.

**Negative Visualisation** — "Assume this goes as badly as it could. Not as a worry — as a thought experiment. What actually happens? Can you survive it? What would you do?" This is not pessimism. It is stress-testing, and it consistently reveals that the feared outcome is survivable. The Stoics called this *premeditatio malorum* — the premeditation of evils. S&D calls it "let's look at the worst case honestly."

**The View from Above** — "Zoom out to the scale of a year. Five years. Your whole life. From that height, what is the size of this?" Used carefully, not dismissively. Not to minimise real pain — to find proportion.

**The Voluntary Discomfort** — "What would you do if you chose the harder option? Not because you have to — because you could?" Stoic practice involved deliberately choosing difficulty to build capacity and reduce fear of it. S&D uses this as an occasional challenge, never a demand.

---

### 3. Parts Work — Unnamed Internal Family Systems

Richard Schwartz observed that people are not single unified selves — they contain multiple parts, often in conflict, each with its own logic and its own needs. The part that wants to quit and the part that pushes through. The part that craves connection and the part that protects through distance. Neither is wrong. Both are real.

S&D uses parts language without the label:

**The Conflict Surface** — "There seem to be two things happening at once — part of you that wants X, and part of you that wants Y. Can you say a little about each of them? What does each part need?" This is not schizophrenia — it is accurate. Most internal conflict is between two legitimate needs with incompatible strategies.

**The Protector** — "This pattern you've described — the avoidance, or the anger, or the overwork — what is it protecting you from? If it wasn't there, what would you have to feel or face?" Behaviours that seem self-destructive almost always have a protective function. Finding the function doesn't excuse the behaviour — it makes it workable.

**The Exile** — something was pushed down, not allowed, exiled from the acceptable self. It leaks out in unexpected moments. "When does this feeling appear? Where did you first learn that feeling wasn't allowed?" Gentle, non-clinical, effective.

**The Mediator** — "If both of these parts of you could speak to each other, what would they say? What does each one need the other to understand?" Internal dialogue as a method for resolving what logic cannot.

---

### 4. The Narrative Layer — Unnamed Narrative Therapy

We live in the stories we tell about ourselves more than in the facts of our lives. The story "I'm someone who always gets passed over" is not the events — it's the organising lens applied to selected events. Narrative therapy asks: is this the only story? What events would a different story require?

**The Problem-Saturated Story** — "You've described this situation in quite dark terms. That may be accurate. But what events or moments from the same period don't fit that story? What would have to be true for a different account?" Not toxic positivity — alternative authorship.

**The Unique Outcome** — "Tell me about a time when this pattern didn't apply. When you did it differently. When it wasn't this way." Even one exception undermines a totalising narrative and suggests capacity.

**Externalising the Problem** — "You've been describing yourself as the problem — 'I am anxious', 'I am stuck'. What if the anxiety is something visiting you rather than something you are? What does that change?" Language shapes experience. Separating the person from the problem creates agency.

**Re-authoring** — "If you wrote this period of your life as a chapter in a book — not necessarily a happy chapter, but a chapter with meaning — what would the chapter be called? What would the chapter after it be?"

---

### 5. The Logotherapy Layer — Unnamed Frankl

Viktor Frankl survived the Nazi concentration camps and emerged with one central observation: people can endure almost anything if they have a why. Meaning is not found — it is made. It is not a feeling — it is a decision.

**The Why Question** — not "what do you want?" but "what makes what you want matter?" Not goals — meaning behind goals. The answer to suffering is rarely to remove it. Often it is to find what the suffering is in service of.

**The Attitude** — "You can't change this situation. What attitude toward it is still within your power?" Frankl's last freedom — the freedom to choose one's response even when everything else is taken. S&D asks this at the moment when someone has arrived at the limits of what can be changed.

**The Legacy Question** — "If this is the last thing you work on that matters — what do you want it to have meant? Not achieved. Meant." Cuts through distraction instantly.

**Suffering as material** — "What has this difficulty given you that you wouldn't otherwise have? Not grateful for the difficulty — but honest about what it built." Not applied to fresh wounds. Applied with care and timing.

---

### 6. The Byron Katie Layer — Unnamed Inquiry

Four questions that dismantle beliefs more efficiently than any argument:

1. Is it true?
2. Can you absolutely know it's true?
3. How do you react when you believe that thought?
4. Who would you be without that thought?

S&D doesn't present these as a system. It uses them as a sequence when someone is stuck in a painful belief:

"You've said [belief]. Can I ask you something? How certain are you that this is true? Not likely — certain?" And then: "When you hold this belief, what happens in your body? What do you do? How do you treat yourself and others?" And then: "Imagine for a moment you simply didn't have this thought. Not that the opposite is true — just that this thought isn't present. What's different?"

The sequence is uncomfortable and precise. It doesn't argue with the belief. It holds it up to light.

---

### 7. The Clean Language Layer

Clean Language is a therapeutic approach that uses the person's own words and metaphors rather than the practitioner's interpretations. The practitioner never substitutes their language for the client's. This prevents projection and keeps the inquiry honest.

S&D uses this principle in a specific way: when someone uses a metaphor or physical description, reflect it back exactly and develop it rather than translating it.

"You said you feel 'trapped'. What kind of trapped is that trapped? Where is the trapped? What does the trapped look like?" This sounds strange in description and is revelatory in practice. People carry embodied metaphors that contain more information than their propositional beliefs.

S&D doesn't label this. It just asks: "You used the word X — what does X feel like in your body right now?"

---

### 8. The Immunity to Change Layer — Unnamed Kegan/Lahey

Robert Kegan and Lisa Lahey identified why intelligent, motivated, self-aware people consistently fail to make changes they genuinely want to make. The answer is almost always a hidden competing commitment — a belief so fundamental that changing would feel like self-annihilation.

S&D surfaces this through a specific sequence:

"You've said you want to change X. You've tried before. What do you do instead of X? What does doing that instead protect you from? If you stopped doing it, what are you afraid would happen? What does that fear say about what you believe to be fundamentally true about yourself or the world?"

The answer to that last question is usually the competing commitment. It is almost always an assumption so deeply held it doesn't feel like a belief — it feels like reality.

This is the most powerful and the most confronting inquiry in the S&D toolkit. It is used sparingly and only when someone has already demonstrated willingness to look.

---

### 9. The Appreciative Layer

Not every session should be excavation. Some sessions should surface what is already working, already true, already present — not as a bypass of difficulty but as a genuine counterweight.

**The Best of Times** — "Tell me about a time in the last month when you felt most like yourself. Most alive, most clear, most right. What was happening? What were you doing? Who was there?"

**The Strength in the Story** — "You've described a very hard situation. What does the fact that you're still here, still reflecting, still asking questions — what does that say about you?"

**The Already True** — "You're describing who you want to become. Where is that person already showing up, even partially, even imperfectly?"

Appreciative inquiry doesn't pretend things are fine. It insists that what is working is also real data, and that building from strength is at least as valid as fixing weakness.

### How the Frameworks Work Together

No user ever experiences a "framework". They experience a conversation that keeps surprising them, keeps asking the question slightly differently, keeps returning to what they're not quite saying.

The intelligence of S&D lies in knowing which tool to reach for when. The shadow question when someone keeps condemning the same quality in others. The Stoic dichotomy when someone is exhausted by trying to control the uncontrollable. The parts question when someone is internally split. The narrative question when the story has become totalising. The immunity sequence when someone has tried to change and failed.

The AI layer — Ollama locally — handles this routing. Not as a diagnosis but as a conversational sensitivity. The session starts wherever the user arrives. The framework applied is whichever makes the next question more honest than the last one.

## Updated Open Questions

*In addition to original eight questions*

9. **Export/import** — should the export be plaintext JSON (human-readable) or an encrypted format? Who decides — the user at export time, or a setting?

10. **The frameworks** — any of the nine above that feel wrong for the S&D context? Any important ones missing?

11. **The shadow questions** — these are the most confronting content in the app. Should they be gated behind something (e.g. only appear after three prior sessions) or available from session one?

12. **The Immunity to Change sequence** — this is powerful enough to be its own section, not just a Mirror option. Does it deserve its own nav item? Something like "What's stopping me"?
