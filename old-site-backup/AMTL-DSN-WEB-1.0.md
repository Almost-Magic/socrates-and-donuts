### Hero

```
See your business the way an attacker does.

Digital Sentinel scans your external presence using the same
tools and techniques a real attacker would use — then tells you
what they'd find, what it means, and exactly how to fix it.

No agents to install. No access to grant.
Just your domain name.

### Section: How It Works

```
HOW IT WORKS

1. You give us your domain name
   That's all we need. We never log into your network.

2. We scan from the outside
   49 professional security tools examine your public
   presence — domains, ports, vulnerabilities, leaked
   credentials, dark web mentions, vendor risks.

3. You receive intelligence
   Not raw data. A clear report with your risk grade,
   what we found, what it means for your business,
   and a step-by-step plan to fix it.

Turnaround: 24 hours for Quick Scans.
3-5 business days for comprehensive assessments.

### Section: What We Scan

```
WHAT WE CHECK

External attack surface — open ports, exposed services,
outdated software, misconfigurations.

Email security — SPF, DKIM, DMARC, mail server hardening.

Leaked credentials — employee emails found in data breaches,
passwords exposed on the dark web.

Vendor risk — third-party services connected to your domain,
each one scanned and graded.

AI security — if you have a chatbot or AI tool, we test it
for vulnerabilities that most businesses don't know exist.

Compliance posture — findings mapped to Essential Eight,
CPS 234, ISO 27001, SOCI Act, and Privacy Act 1988.

Dark web exposure — mentions of your domain, employee data,
or credentials on underground forums and marketplaces.

Brand impersonation — lookalike domains registered by
attackers to impersonate your business.

### Compliance Access Note

```
ABOUT DEEP COMPLIANCE ASSESSMENTS

For most services, we never access your network. Everything
is assessed externally — the way an attacker would see it.

For the full Essential Eight and CPS 234 assessments, we need
temporary, read-only access to your cloud dashboards (M365,
AWS/Azure/GCP, Intune/JAMF, backup system). We send you a
one-page checklist — your IT person or MSP can set it up in
minutes.

Access is read-only. We never make changes. Access is revoked
after 48 hours.

### Heading

```
About Digital Sentinel
```

### Body

```
Digital Sentinel was built by Mani Padisetti at Almost Magic
Tech Lab in Sydney.

The problem is simple: Australian small and mid-sized businesses
are told they need cybersecurity, but the solutions available
are either too expensive (enterprise platforms at $30K+ per year)
or too shallow (a simple scan that tells you nothing useful).

Digital Sentinel sits in between. Professional-grade cyber
intelligence — the same tools and techniques used by security
firms charging six figures — delivered as a one-time engagement
at a price a small business can actually afford.

We never log into your network. We scan from the outside,
exactly as an attacker would. Then we translate what we find
into plain language, map it to Australian compliance frameworks,
and give you a clear plan to fix it.

No annual contracts. No lock-in. No jargon.
```

### Section: Our Approach

```
EXTERNAL-ONLY BY DEFAULT
We show you what attackers see. We never touch your internal
network unless you explicitly request a deep compliance
assessment — and even then, it's read-only and temporary.

AUSTRALIAN COMPLIANCE NATIVE
Every report maps to Essential Eight, CPS 234, ISO 27001,
SOCI Act, and Privacy Act 1988. No global vendor does this
for Australian SMBs.

AI-POWERED NARRATIVES
Our reports tell stories, not just list vulnerabilities.
Your executive summary is written for leadership. Your
technical report is written for IT. Both come from the
same scan.

ONE-TIME PRICING
Pay for what you need, when you need it. No subscriptions.
No annual commitments. Optional quarterly re-scans if you
want to track improvement over time.
```

### Section: Guarantee

```
OUR GUARANTEE

If your report contains no actionable findings, you pay nothing.

We've never had to issue this refund. Every business has
something to fix. But the guarantee stands — because you
shouldn't have to take our word for it.

## TONE GUIDE FOR DEVELOPER

- Australian English spelling throughout
- No exclamation marks in body copy
- No "Hey!" or "Welcome!" or "Let's go!"
- No emoji in body copy
- No American idioms (see DEC-020 banned phrases)
- Professional but direct — not corporate, not casual
- Assume the reader knows nothing about cybersecurity
- Use plain language — "open ports" not "externally accessible TCP listeners"
- When describing technical things, follow immediately with what it means
  for the business (e.g., "outdated software — attackers can exploit
  known vulnerabilities to access your systems")
- The voice is confident but not arrogant. "We find things" not "We're
  the best at finding things"
- Mani Padisetti credited as founder throughout
