## Welcome

Socrates & Donuts is your daily thinking partner. It asks one question a day — a good one — and gives you space to sit with it before answering. Over time, it remembers how you think, surfaces patterns you can't see yourself, and gently challenges you when your thinking contradicts itself.

It's not therapy. It's not meditation. It's not a journal. It's the examined life, one question at a time.

## Your Daily Practice

### 1. The Question Arrives

Every day at your chosen time, S&D sends you a question:
- As a browser notification (if you've allowed it)
- As an SMS (if you've set that up)
- Or just waiting for you when you open S&D

### 2. Sit With It (Forced Silence)

When you see the question, the response area is locked. A gentle breathing circle appears — expanding and contracting slowly. This is the Forced Silence.

Why? Because the answer you give after sitting with a question is different from your first reaction. Better. Deeper. More honest.

When the circle completes, a soft chime sounds and the text area unlocks. Now you can write.

### 3. Respond

Write whatever comes. There's no right length. One word is fine. Three paragraphs is fine. The point is honesty, not eloquence.

### 4. "Did That Land?"

After you finish, S&D asks: "Did that land?"

Three options:
- **Yes** — the question reached something real
- **Not sure** — it was interesting but you're not certain
- **Not today** — not the right time for this question (and that's okay)

This helps S&D learn which kinds of questions work best for you.

## Features

### My Reflections

Everything you've written lives here:
- **Past Sessions** — every question you've answered, searchable by keyword, tag, or date
- **Saved Insights** — one-sentence truths you've saved from sessions
- **Wisdom Library** — aphorisms and insights collected over time
- **Letters** — one-year letters (time-locked) and unsent letters

### Practices

- **Forced Silence** — use the silence timer on its own, without a question
- **Vipassana Log** — pre-sit orientation, hindrance tracking, post-sit integration
- **Somatic Check-in** — "Where in your body is this right now?"

### Dialogues (Requires AI Connection)

If you've connected your own AI:
- **The Other Side** — "What if the opposite were true?" A different vantage point
- **Three Ways to Look at This** — three perspectives on your situation, from different angles

### Arc Sessions

Multi-day themed explorations — 7 to 10 days around a single theme (fear, money, choice, loss). Each day's question builds on your previous answer.

## Settings

### Intensity

How deep should the questions go? You control this.

| Level | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| **Gentle** | Light reflection, no challenge. Gratitude, narrative, appreciation |
| **Reflective** | Moderate inquiry with gentle challenge (this is the default) |
| **Deep** | Full Socratic inquiry. Parts work, reframing, hidden commitments |
| **Confronting** | Shadow work, existential inquiry. Only if you're ready |

You can change this any time. Start gentle. Go deeper when you're ready.

### Domains

Choose which areas of life S&D can ask about:
- Work & Purpose
- Relationships
- Body & Health
- Belief & Identity
- Money & Security
- Grief & Loss
- Creativity

Turn off any domain you don't want to explore right now. No explanation needed.

### Connect AI (Optional)

S&D works without AI. But if you want a thinking partner that responds to what you write, you can connect your own:

1. Go to Settings → Connect AI
2. Choose your provider (Ollama, Claude, OpenAI, DeepSeek, or custom)
3. Enter your API key
4. Click "Test Connection"

**Your key stays on your device.** S&D never sends it anywhere except directly to your chosen AI provider.

### Notifications

Choose when and how the daily question reaches you:
- Browser push notification (time configurable)
- SMS (requires TextBee setup)
- Or just open S&D when you're ready

### Export & Import

- **Export:** Download your entire vault as a JSON file. Keep it safe — it's your reflection history
- **Import:** Upload a previously exported JSON file to restore everything

This is how you move between devices or keep a backup.

## What the Colours Mean

| Colour | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Gold circle | Forced Silence active — sit with the question |
| Green | Session saved, insight saved, connection healthy |
| Amber | Something needs attention (notification permission, LLM disconnected) |
| Red | Safety mode activated — S&D has paused to check in with you |

---

## When S&D Pauses

Sometimes S&D detects that what you're writing might be bigger than a question. If that happens, it gently pauses:

> "This feels like it might be bigger than a question right now. Would it help to talk to someone?"

This isn't a judgment. It's a fellow traveller checking in. S&D will offer resources if you want them, and won't push if you don't.

## About S&D

Named after a philosopher who never wrote anything down and a pastry that asks nothing of you. One brings the questions. The other brings the kindness. You need both.
